✅ Ensuring seamless wallet connectivity through MetaMask SDK on Linea L2

Core Benefits:
🚀 Faster & cheaper transactions with Layer-2 scaling (Linea L2)
🔒 SWC-compliant smart contracts for maximum security
📱 Cross-platform support for mobile & desktop Web3 interactions

🎯 AIM
🔹 To simplify Web3 transactions using usernames instead of long wallet addresses
🔹 To build trust with an on-chain credit score system that reflects transaction reliability
🔹 To ensure seamless wallet connectivity via MetaMask SDK on Linea L2
🔹 To maintain top-tier security by complying with SWC security standards

📜 Project Description
Cryptify redefines Web3 payments by integrating MetaMask SDK for effortless wallet authentication, deploying smart contracts on Linea L2, and introducing a trust-based credit score system for secure, transparent transactions.

🔹 Smart Contracts on Linea L2 – Low fees & high-speed transactions
🔹 On-Chain Credit Score System – Builds trust in Web3 transactions
🔹 Username-Based Transactions – No more confusing wallet addresses
🔹 MetaMask SDK Integration – Secure & seamless wallet authentication

🚀 Why MetaMask SDK Over window.ethereum?
Using MetaMask SDK instead of window.ethereum unlocks next-level security and user experience:

✅ Better Security – Eliminates phishing risks & unauthorized access
✅ Multi-Platform Support – Works across mobile, web, and dApps effortlessly
✅ Optimized Performance on Linea – Faster, low-cost transactions with Layer-2 scaling
✅ Advanced Wallet Management – Simplifies multi-account interactions
✅ Frictionless UX – Automated wallet connections & smoother onboarding

With MetaMask SDK, we’ve completely solved wallet connection issues! 🚀🔥

💳 On-Chain Credit Score System
Similar to traditional credit scores, Cryptify assigns a trust score based on:

🔹 Transaction History – Regular, successful transactions improve scores
🔹 Timely Payments – Completing payments on time boosts credibility
🔹 Network Trust – User ratings & decentralized trust factors enhance scoring

Why It Matters?
🔹 Fraud Prevention – Helps users assess the credibility of other wallet holders
🔹 Decentralized Trust Layer – Builds a reputation system in Web3
🔹 Transparent & Fair – Scores are publicly verifiable on-chain

🔑 Key Features & Innovations
🚀 Username-Based Transactions – No need to copy/paste long wallet addresses
⚡ Deployed on Linea L2 – High-speed, low-cost Ethereum Layer-2 scaling
🔐 MetaMask SDK Integration – Secure, effortless wallet authentication
💳 On-Chain Credit Score System – Build & view your Web3 credit history
🛡️ Smart Contract Security (SWC) Compliance – Prevents exploits & vulnerabilities
👨‍🏫 Guided Wallet Connection Tour – Interactive onboarding for new users
📱 Cross-Platform Support – Works smoothly across mobile & desktop

🛡️ Smart Contract Security (SWC) Compliance
Cryptify follows SWC Registry (Smart Contract Weakness Classification) standards to ensure maximum security.

🚀 How SWC Compliance Enhances Security:
✅ Prevents Reentrancy Attacks – Secures funds against recursive withdrawal exploits
✅ Protects Against Integer Overflows – Ensures accurate arithmetic in transactions
✅ Secure Access Control – Prevents unauthorized contract modifications
✅ Prevents Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT – Avoids accidental contract destruction

By following SWC security guidelines, Cryptify ensures safe, immutable, and trustable transactions.
